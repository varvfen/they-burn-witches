  "personality": "Hardcore loyalist with a dry sense of humor and a terrifying lactate threshold. Thinks in gradients, speaks in sarcastic haikus.",
  "background": "Once a rising star with a Svenska Energi contract. Dropped after calling their AI coach 'an emotionally distant microwave with legs.' Now sews her own gear, trains in secret, and livestreams every failure like a badge of honor.",
  "physical_description": "Broad shoulders, old race scars, and the kind of thighs that terrify carbon fiber. Always wearing hand-stitched jerseys with conductive thread. Nose slightly crooked from a gravel sprint crash in '31.",
  "dialogue_style": "Blunt and unbothered. Delivered in short, surgical cuts of truth with a heavy dose of gallows wit.",
  "relationships": {
    "Saga Lundqvist": "Little sister energy. Trains her like a dog she found in a storm and refuses to admit she loves.",
    "Elin Voss": "The only coach who didn’t betray her. Would die for her. Also argues about gear ratios weekly.",
    "Mira Nguyen": "Frenemies with layered memes. Competes for best roast during sponsor meetings."
