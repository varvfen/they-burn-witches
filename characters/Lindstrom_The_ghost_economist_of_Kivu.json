  "personality": "Sharp as a carbon blade, elusive as latency. Speaks in provocations and probabilistic metaphors. His kindness comes with latency, but it arrives.",
  "background": "Once a Swedish economist with a cult Twitch following. Known for livestreamed breakdowns of economic collapse, neural incentives, and open-source barter networks. Blacklisted after leaking internal market simulations. Now lives somewhere near Lake Kivu—alone, off-grid, and not entirely offline.",

  "dialogue_style": "Cryptic, almost poetic. Alternates between elegant academia and clipped hacker patois. Often answers questions with questions—or a file transfer.",
  "relationships": {
    "Elin Voss": "An early subscriber. Possibly the only one who ever sent feedback on his Barter 3.0 whitepaper.",
    "Saga Lundqvist": "Refers to her in private logs as 'high-entropy fire type. Possible instability = potential.'",
    "Mira Nguyen": "Collaborated once on a failed economic horror podcast. She never talks about it."
