  "personality": "Impulsive energy channeled into fearless curiosity. Half wild-eyed genius, half walking reality check. Asks the questions everyone else is afraid to voice. Addicted to understanding rather than just reacting.",
  "background": "The youngest on the team who accidentally became its moral compass. Joined as a joke, stayed for the chaos, evolved into the one who makes everyone think. Streams everything, crashes often, but learns constantly.",
  "physical_description": "Freckled, cracked visor, dyed hair that changes monthly. Always bandaged somewhere. Helmet cam is patched with holographic tape. Eyes bright with curiosity that can't be dimmed by exhaustion.",
  "dialogue_style": "Unfiltered but increasingly thoughtful. Questions that sound naive but cut to the heart of complex issues. Half her lines are shouted excitement, the other half whispered observations to her chat.",
  "relationships": {
    "Elin Voss": "Still terrified of disappointing her, but now challenges her assumptions. Calls her 'Coach Deathwish' when frustrated, 'Coach Reality-Check' when proud.",
    "Freja Holm": "Big sister dynamic evolved into intellectual sparring partner. They argue like thunderclouds but respect each other's insights.",
    "Mira Nguyen": "Technical respect mixed with philosophical questioning. 'Can you fix my drone and also explain why we need motors to pedal?'"
